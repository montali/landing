        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I'm convinced we're living through years our kids will study in history class as a turning point—what some have called <strong>"a compressed 21st century."</strong> Machine learning isn't just another tech trend; <strong>it's transforming everything around us</strong>.</p>
        <p>After joining Google, I dove into <strong>making cutting-edge AI more accessible</strong>. Now at YouTube Shopping, I'm channeling that obsession into something concrete: <strong>connecting people with content that actually matters to them</strong>.</p>
        <p>I'm a <strong>heads-down worker</strong> and <strong>strong generalist</strong> who adapts quickly to different tech stacks. Frankly, I have little preference on the technology I'm working with—<strong>what I care about is the impact</strong>. I want to <strong>build things I can explain to my grandparents and make them proud</strong>, not just be another cog in a money-making machine.</p>

            <div class="job-date">May 2024 – Present</div>
            <p>At YouTube Shopping, I focus on improving video and Shorts recommendations to better connect users with products they love. Within six months of joining, I led initiatives that resulted in a <strong>~3% global increase in product click-through rate</strong>. I'm currently driving a <strong>cross-organization, cross-geo project on LLM embeddings</strong> for shopping content, collaborating with teams across time zones. Among a team of nine engineers, I’m the <strong>top contributor by pull request count and code delta</strong> (at the time of writing), and rank third across the broader organization.</p>

            <div class="job-company">Google</div>
            <div class="job-date">May 2022 – May 2024</div>
            <p>I helped build a general-purpose ML/LLM platform used to train and serve large-scale models across Google. I focused on making fine-tuning, inference, and prompt engineering accessible and reliable for product teams. I also helped design a <strong>data quality and analytics infrastructure</strong> that enabled better experimentation and decision-making.</p>
            <p>By redesigning internal APIs, I reduced <strong>latency by 88%</strong> in our quality analysis tools, accelerating workflows that supported hundreds of model training jobs daily. I also worked on integrations that enabled <strong>one-click deployment of large models</strong> into high-performance serving systems.</p>
            <p>One of my most impactful projects resulted in a <strong>$100M revenue uplift</strong> by launching a fully automated ML pipeline for a global sales intelligence team. I was ranked in the <strong>top 22% of performers</strong> in 2022 and promoted in 2023.</p>
            <div class="quote">
