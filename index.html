        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I'm convinced we're living through years our kids will study in history class as a turning point—what some
            have called <strong>"a compressed 21st century."</strong> Machine learning isn't just another tech trend;
            <strong>it's transforming everything around us</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>After joining Google, I dove into making <strong>cutting-edge AI more accessible</strong>. At YouTube
            Shopping, I channeled
            that obsession into <strong>connecting people with content</strong> that actually matters to them. Now at
            Meta, I'm pushing
            the boundaries further—leading the <strong>data engine that powers foundation models for VR</strong>,
            working at the
            intersection where AI meets the future of human connection.
        </p>
        <p>I'm a <strong>heads-down worker</strong> and <strong>strong generalist</strong> who adapts quickly to
            different tech stacks. Frankly, I have little preference on the technology I'm working with—<strong>what I
                care about is the impact</strong>. I want to <strong>build things I can explain to my grandparents and
                make them proud</strong>, not just be another cog in a money-making machine.</p>

            <p>As a Senior ML Software Engineer at Meta, my role spans computer vision for <strong>VR, ML
                    infrastructure, and
                    large-scale models</strong>. I'm currently leading the development of a <strong>new data
                    engine</strong> that supports our Reality
                Labs team working on foundation models for virtual reality. This work involves building robust
                <strong>ML
                    infrastructure</strong>, designing efficient data pipelines, <strong>implementing state-of-the-art
                    vision-language
                    models</strong>, and creating extensive automation systems. These efforts drive significant business
                impact by
                enabling researchers to <strong>iterate faster while improving overall model quality and
                    performance.</strong>

                <strong>cross-organization, cross-geo project on LLM embeddings</strong> for shopping content,
                collaborating with teams across time zones. Among a team of nine engineers, I'm the <strong>top
                    contributor by pull request count and code delta</strong> (at the time of writing), and rank third
                across the broader organization.

            <p>I helped build a general-purpose ML/LLM platform used to train and serve large-scale models across
                Google. I focused on making fine-tuning, inference, and prompt engineering accessible and reliable for
                product teams. I also helped design a <strong>data quality and analytics infrastructure</strong> that
                enabled better experimentation and decision-making.</p>
            <p>By redesigning internal APIs, I reduced <strong>latency by 88%</strong> in our quality analysis tools,
                accelerating workflows that supported hundreds of model training jobs daily. I also worked on
                integrations that enabled <strong>one-click deployment of large models</strong> into high-performance
                serving systems.</p>
            <p>One of my most impactful projects resulted in a <strong>$100M revenue uplift</strong> by launching a
                fully automated ML pipeline for a global sales intelligence team. I was ranked in the <strong>top 22% of
                    performers</strong> in 2022 and promoted in 2023.</p>
